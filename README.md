# Near Newspaper
Near Newspaper is a Near on-chain editor where you could type and format your text and ideas, play with colors, fonts & images, export, share and collect feedback on your newspaper on Near blockchain.

We wish to create a Near-powered authoring and self-publishing platform to support the development of community newspapers and publications on Near blockchain, thereby encouraging the development of an eco-system based on the foundation of sharing of ideas and active collaboration among the community members. 

Near Blockchain-powered solution Features:

1. Content design and formatting capabilities.
2. Five sets of newspaper templates.
3. A “Create your own template” tool to create layouts of your choice through different-sized and formatted text and photo boxes. Ability to share these templates and get feedback on improvements in content and presentation on Near blockchain.
4. Ability to import pictures from the clipboard.
5. Additional fonts that are related to the newspapers.
6. Ability to share your newspapers with other community members and get feedback on Near blockchain.


Near Blockchain Usage and Development:

We have built Near Newspaper using Javascript, HTML5 and CSS on the front-end and Near Blockchain:

- Near low code framework tools and community tooling for analytics platform: Secure data storage, transparent data movement, data analytics and data authenticity using Near low code tools. 

- Feedback Report Management on Near Blockchain: We are also utilizing Near Protocol to receive newspaper feedback reports by educators and community members, store feedback details so that the newspaper creators could strategize more productively and do early stage improvements in presentation and content structuring.

- Near's user content NFT registration module is to enable users to register their citizen IDs as well as their contact address details in a decentralized manner. An individual can be identified by his/her SSN and a contact address by Contact Registry Number both of which for now are integers between 0 and 65535 (16 bit integers). Every SSN or individual is associated to an address of an individual Near account. We are developing our own NFT smart contract from the ground up following Near's NEP-171 standard and the key tutorial shared at the Near github website. We are also logging the identities of the newspaper content owners, their newspaper content assets using exchange of unique identifiers powered by Near.
